# enstore

In-memory persistence for streams. Enables you to replay streams, even if they're not finished yet.

## Usage

```js
var enstore = require('enstore');

// create a new store
var store = enstore();

// store a someStream in it
someStream.pipe(store.createWriteStream());

// pipe everything someStream emitted to someWhereElse
// doesn't matter if someStream already finished
store.createWriteStream().pipe(someWhereElse);
```
